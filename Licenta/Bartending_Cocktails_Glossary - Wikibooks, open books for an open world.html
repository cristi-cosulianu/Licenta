<dl><dt>Apple Martini (aka Appletini)</dt>
<dd>Vodka and either apple juice, apple cider or apple liqueur. Typically, the apple vodka is shaken or stirred with a sweet and sour mix and then strained into a Martini glass. May be garnished with a slice of Granny Smith apple.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Apple Pie Shooter</dt>
<dd>2 oz (6nbsp;cl) apple juice, 1 oz (3&nbsp;cl) vodka, whipped cream in a can, and cinnamon sugar in a salt or pepper shaker. Two people are required. The designated drinker sits in a chair with head back and mouth open.  The second person pours the apple juice and then the vodka into the mouth.  In order for the full taste of the drink to come out, the drinker must keep his or her throat closed, this also prevents choking.  The second person then adds a good size shot of whipped cream and a light sprinkling of the cinnamon sugar.  The drinker then sits up, swishes to mix the ingredients, swallows.  There can be different recipes for this shot; some do 1 part vodka, 1 part apple juice; others do 2:1 parts, it all depends on how strong the shot is wanted.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Apricot Pie</dt>
<dd>0.5&nbsp;oz (1.5&nbsp;cl) light rum, 0.5&nbsp;oz (1.5&nbsp;cl) sweet vermouth, 4 dashes each of apricot brandy and lemon juice, 2 dashes of grenadine. Shake mixture with ice and strain into a glass.</dd></dl>

Use a Collins glass with or without ice, dash in the lemon juice and bitters, add the energy drink, fill up the glass with even amounts of orange and pineapple juice, stir all ingredients, garnish with a lemon wedge. The Avenger is a sweet party cocktail with a tropical flavour, originating from Melbourne, Australia.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Aviation</dt>
<dd>2&nbsp;oz (6nbsp;cl) gin (or vodka), 1&nbsp;oz (3&nbsp;cl) lemon juice, 1&nbsp;oz (3&nbsp;cl) maraschino liqueur. Shake or stir with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass. Serve with a cherry. Common brands of maraschino are Maraska, Luxardo and Stock. Other cherry-flavoured liqueurs or the syrup from maraschino cherries should not be substituted, as they are much sweeter and have a very different taste.</dd></dl>

The <b>B-52</b> is a layered shot served in a pousse-cafe glass. Variations include using half measures in a shot glass, using teaspoons of grand marnier to fill a double shot glass. Alternatively, in a rocks glass, stir and strain into ice-filled glass. Kahlua may be replaced with another coffee liqueur, Baileys with another Irish Cream and Grand Marnier with another Curaçao.

<dd>1 measure (30&nbsp;mL) brandy, 1 measure (30&nbsp;mL) Benedictine. Float the Brandy on top of the Benedictine.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Baby Guinness</dt>
<dd>Tia Maria, topped up with Baileys. The Baileys should be poured into the Tia Maria using the back of a spoon, this slows down the pouring of the Baileys and should allow the Baileys to sit on top of the Tia Maria to look like a baby pint of Guinness.  The glass used to drink this should be a small whiskey glass or a shot/shooter glass. It is very sweet to taste which is why it is very popular among young adults.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Bailey's Comet</dt>
<dd>½ shot (15&nbsp;mL) of Baileys Irish Cream, ½ shot (15&nbsp;mL) of Goldschlager (although any thin flammable cinnamon except Hot Damn will do), splash of flammable alcohol (Bacardi 151 works well), pinch of cinnamon. Fill shot glass half way with Baileys Irish Cream. Layer on top half shot of Goldschlager. Add splash of flammable alcohol. Dim the lights, and ignite. Sprinkling cinnamon into the flame will cause sparks to appear in an otherwise dim blue flame.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Banana Banshee</dt>
<dd>2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) cream, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) banana liqueur and 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) cacao liqueur (white). Pour into an ice filled shaker. Shake and pour into a cocktail glass.

<dl><dt>Banana Daiquiri</dt>
<dd>2 measures (60&nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 measure banana liqueur (Pisang Ambon), 1 measure (30&nbsp;mL) lime juice, half a banana, crushed ice. Mix the rum, banana liqueur, lime juice, the banana and the ice in a blender. Strain into a cocktail glass.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Bandera</dt>
<dd>1 shot (30&nbsp;mL) of silver tequila, 1 shot (30&nbsp;mL) of sangrita, 1 shot (30&nbsp;mL) of lemon juice, salt on a small dish. There is no method to mix this drink.  You should drink, one at a time, the shot of tequila, sangrita and lemon juice.  Salt is used for lowering the 'boom' of the tequila. Named after the Mexican flag.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Bandito</dt>
<dd>1 part Kahlúa, 3 parts ginger ale, ice. Pour Kahlúa into glass with ice. Top off with ginger ale. Tastes sweet.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Bastille Bomb</dt>
<dd>1 part blue curaçao, 1 part Cointreau, 1 part grenadine. The Bastille Bomb is a layered shot. First add the grenadine (the most dense of the liquids), then the curaçao, then the Cointreau (the least dense).</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Bellbird</dt>
<dd>1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) gold rum, ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) Razzmatazz (crème de cassis and chambord are acceptable substitutions), ¾ fill with cranberry juice, ¼ fill with pineapple juice. Build drink in an iced hurricane glass, roll into shaker for a few shakes, pour back into glass, garnish with a squeeze of lime and serve.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Bellini</dt>
<dd>2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) white peach purée, 5 oz (150&nbsp;mL) prosecco sparkling wine. Pour peach purée then prosecco into a mixing glass filled with ice. Gently roll the shaker end over end to mix the ingredients. Do not shake as shaking will make the prosecco flat and could cause the mixing glass to explode. Strain into a champagne glass and serve. Bartender Giusepi Cipriani invented this cocktail at Harry's Bar, Venice in 1948. The drink was named after the 15th century Italian painter, Giovanni Bellini. It is reported that the pink glow of one of Bellini's painting is the inspiration to this cocktail. Originally this cocktail would only be made for four months of the year when the white peaches were in season. This was the case until Giusepi's son Arrigo began using a flash frozen peach purée. With the opening of Harry's Bar in New York City, the Bellini has been embraced throughout the western hemisphere.</dd></dl>

<dd>Stout beer (such as Guinness) and another, lighter beer (such as an ale or lager). A common technique is to fill the glass half full of the light beer, and then carefully pour the dark beer in, over an upside-down spoon, so that the two don't mix.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Bartending/Cocktails/Black_Velvet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bartending/Cocktails/Black Velvet (does not exist)">Black Velvet</a></dt>
<dd>6 oz (180&nbsp;mL) cold Guinness, 6 oz (180&nbsp;mL) cold dry champagne or other dry sparkling wine. A black velvet is made by filling a tall flute glass halfway full of chilled stout and floating the sparkling wine on top of the stout, with the differing densities of the liquids allowing them to remain largely in separate layers (as in a pousse-café). The effect is best achieved if it is poured over a spoon turned upside down over the top of the glass so that the liquid runs gently down the sides rather than splashing into the lower layer and mixing with it. A "champagne in mourning" mixture created in 1861 to commemorate German-born Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's consort, who died of typhoid fever at age 42. Black Velvet is also known as Bismark and Champagne Velvet. According to <i>Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</i>, the black velvet was the favorite drink of Otto von Bismarck, who supposedly drank it by the gallon. In Germany, the cocktail often goes by his name. A common variation is the <b>poor man's black velvet</b>, prepared with a cider or perry bottom layer.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Blaster Bates</dt>
<dd><i>Blaster Bates</i> is a type of alcoholic fruit drink, believed to be first founded in Cheshire, England and named after local personality Blaster Bates. It is made with 2 measure<span>s</span> <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits#Vodka" title="Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits">vodka</a>, 4 oz. Orange Juice, 2 oz.

The Blaster is taken by dropping the shot of Jägermeister into a Collins glass and drinking like a shot. The drink is popular because it causes intoxication and also allegedly lets the drinker become more alert.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Bleeding Brain (Brain Haemorrhage)</dt>
<dd>1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) peach schnapps, ¼ oz (7&nbsp;mL) Baileys, dash of grenadine. Pour schnapps into a shot glass. Float Baileys over the back of a spoon. Pour a little grenadine through the Baileys until it falls into the schnapps.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Blue Lagoon</dt>
<dd>1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) vodka, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) Malibu rum, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) blue curaçao, 7 oz (200&nbsp;mL) lemonade. Optionally, sugar the glass rim. Shake vodka and rum with crushed ice poured into the glass. Add lemonade, then pour blue curacao down the inside of the glass for effect. Many bars will use one shot (30&nbsp;mL) of blue curaçao, throw in some lemon bar mix, and call it a Blue Lagoon. Supposedly created in the 1960's by Andy MacElhone (son of Harry, of Harry's Bar in Paris ).</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Blue Blazer</dt>
<dd>1 part boiling water, 1 part whisky, 1 tsp (5&nbsp;mL) powdered sugar or honey, lemon peel garnish (optional). The whisky, ignited, is poured from one mug into the mug of boiling water, back and forth until the blue flame goes out (4-6 times). It is then poured into the serving mug or Irish Coffee mug containing the honey or sugar and lemon peel. It was created by Jerry Thomas, a bartender and author, while working at the El Dorado in San Francisco.  Reportedly while making the drink, US President Ulysses S Grant was so impressed that he gave Thomas a cigar. Thomas would only make the drink if the outside temperature was 10&nbsp;°C or below or if the person ordering the drink had a cold or the flu, whose symptoms the drink was to alleviate. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://cocktails.about.com/od/coffeehotcocktails/r/blueblazer.htm">[1]</a></dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Bourbon County Cowboy</dt>
<dd>2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) bourbon whiskey, ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) light cream. In a shaker half-filled with ice cubes, combine the bourbon and cream. Shake well. Strain into a cocktail glass.</dd></dl>

<dd>1.5 oz (45&nbsp;mL) brandy or cognac, 0.5 oz (15&nbsp;mL) cointreau, 2 dashes angustura bitters.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Brass Monkey</dt>
<dd>Equal parts vodka, rum and orange juice. It is thus essentially a screwdriver with rum added. Pulp-free orange juice is usually desirable for reasons of palatability, though freshly squeezed juice may also yield a good brass monkey. Dark rum is also preferable, since it is the mixing of the brown rum with the orange juice that produces the distinct brass-like coloration for which this drink is named. Much of this drink's notoriety comes from the Beastie Boys' song: "Monkey tastes Def when you pour it on ice. Come on y'all it's time to get nice". An alternative cocktail, often attributed to the Beastie Boys track, is essentially a variation on a mimosa.  It consists of three parts malt liquor and one part Sunny Delight.  Typically Olde English 800 or St Ides is used, and always in the forty-ounce bottle. The first quarter to third of the bottle is consumed, and then topped off with Sunny D, capped, inverted, and guzzled.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Brave Bull</dt>

<dd>1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) vermouth, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) gin, juice of ¼ orange, 1 slice orange. Shake all ingredients (except orange slice) with ice and strain into a cocktail glass. Add the orange slice and serve. For a dry Bronx cocktail, use dry vermouth; for a Bronx golden cocktail, use half dry and half sweet, and add an egg yolk. The Bronx was supposedly invented by Johnnie Solon of the Waldorf-Astoria bar in Manhattan.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Buck's Fizz</dt>
<dd>Orange juice, chilled Brut champagne, dash of grenadine. Fill a champagne glass ⅓ full of orange juice. Top with champagne and a dash of grenadine. The drink is named after London's Buck's Club where it was first served in 1921. The Buck's Fizz is the English version of the French mimosa and predates the mimosa by 3 years. Both drinks are usually served at breakfast or brunch. Although the recipe given here, with grenadine, may be the original usage, most British people will understand 'Buck's Fizz' to refer to a mixture of orange juice and champagne; i.e. it is the usual British term for what Americans would call a 'Mimosa'. Sometimes, where real Champagne is not available or cannot be afforded, a white wine is used in its place.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Caffè Corretto (Espresso Corretto)</dt>

<dl><dt><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Caipirinha" title="Bartending/Cocktails/Caipirinha">Caipirinha</a></dt>
<dd>One lime (tip: get rid of white centre), 1-2 tsp (5-10 mL) sugar (to taste), cachaça (to fill glass containing lime, sugar, and ice). Cut the lime in four pieces and crush with sugar using a wooden pestle in a whiskey tumbler or similar glass. Add cachaça, stir, and finally add crushed or grained ice, or ice in cubes. The finer the ice, the faster it cools, but also dilutes the mixture. The amount of cachaça can vary from one to two doses, depending on the size of the glass. Although not an original procedure, water may be added to dilute, but it is normally not necessary as the ice will melt. Shake vigorously. Caipirinha is a traditional Brazilian drink. If you don't have cachaça on hand, replace with a good quality clear rum (in this case, the drink is called a "caipiríssima"), or vodka can also be used ("caipiroska"). In Europe, it is fashionable to use brown sugar instead of white, giving the drink a mossy colour and an earthy, warmer feel to it. Some bartenders use simple syrup in order to minimise the mixing needed and crunchiness of sugar crystals. Some people also replace the ice cubes with chopped ice, but this causes it to melt more quickly, watering down the drink. Some health-conscious Brazilians will drink it with a sugar substitute such as aspartame. A "caipifruta" is prepared in the same way, replacing or complementing the lime with any other fruit (always fresh, never juices). Popular fruits include passion fruit, kiwi, lemon, pineapple and strawberry. A caipirinha should be drunk quickly, as the essential oils of the lime peel, set free while pounding the lime halves, will give an unpleasant, bitter taste</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Careless Memory</dt>
<dd>1 part whisky, 1 part Bacardi, 1 part dark rum, 1 part Malibu poured over ice and mixed with Coca-Cola. If the Coca-Cola is flat (as is preferable for this particular drink) the mixture is shaken before serving. The sweetness of the rums and cola combine with the coconut of the Malibu to mask the drink's true alcoholic content. Drinking two is recommended only for those with strong stomachs or a strong desire for amnesia. It is named after a song by pop group Duran Duran and has been likened to Douglas Adams's fictional drink called the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Pan_Galactic_Gargle_Blaster" title="Bartending/Cocktails/Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster">Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster</a>.</dd></dl>

<dd>1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) Baileys, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) lime juice. Fill a shot glass 2/3 full with Baileys, and gently float the lime juice on top.

<dd>90&nbsp;mL (3 oz) Coca-Cola, 30&nbsp;mL (1 oz) rum, 60&nbsp;mL (2 oz) gin (optional), 2 dashes bitters (optional), lime wedge. Rub the rim of a highball glass with the lime. Fill the glass with ice. Add rum. Fill with Coca-Cola. Drop in the lime squeeze. <i>Jones' Bar Guide</i> omits the gin and bitters, but they are said by some to greatly improve the quality of the drink. The Cuba Libre ("Freedom for Cuba") was invented in Havana, Cuba around 1900. Patriots aiding Cuba during the Spanish-American War and, later, expatriates avoiding Prohibition, regularly mixed rum and Coca-Cola as a cocktail and a toast to this West Indies island.

<dd>1 part Kahlúa, 1 part tequila. Pour the Kahlúa, then slowly pour in the tequila so that two distinct layers are form.  Some mixing in the middle is fine (and even desirable) but at the top it should be all tequila. Light the tequila with a lighter, and allow the blue flame to burn.  It helps to use the lighter on the side of the glass too, to warm up all of the liquid.  Works best in a tall shot glass. When the flame starts to taper off (or when you can't hold yourself back any longer, or when you think it's good and hot) suck up all of it through a straw as quickly as possible.</dd></dl>

<dd>This refers to a family of cocktails. Daiquirí Natural is the basic mix, that serves as the starting point to the more complex cocktails of the family: 1.3 oz (40&nbsp;mL) light-dry rum, 0.7 oz (20&nbsp;mL) lime juice, 1 teaspoon (5&nbsp;mL) sugar, crushed ice. Mix the ingredients in a shaker and serve. Daiquiri Floridita is the most common and famous version of this cocktail, allegedly it was invented by Constantino Ribalaigua Vert, barman and owner of the Floridita in the 1950s, whom Ernest Hemingway nicknamed El grande Constante. This recipe is also known as Daiquirí Frappé:  1.5 oz (45&nbsp;mL) light-dry rum, the juice of 1 lime, 1 tsp (5&nbsp;mL) sugar, crushed ice, 10 drops of maraschino liqueur. Mix all the ingredients in a blender until the ice is finely crushed and serve iced. Strawberry Daiquiri: ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) strawberry schnapps, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) lime juice, 1 tsp (5&nbsp;mL) powdered sugar, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) strawberries, crushed ice. Mix all the ingredients in a blender until the ice is finely crushed and serve iced. Other versions: Papa's is the version of the cocktail that Hemingway allegedly preferred (Papa is the nickname that fishermen gave Hemingway in Cuba), is identical to the Floridita Daiquiri, it only substitutes lime juice with grapefruit juice. It is said that Hemingway drank this cocktail with no sugar and doubled the rum. Mulata is the same cocktail as the Floridita Daiquiri, but instead of light-dry rum (which is colourless) it requires aged rum, which gives the cocktail an amber colour. Other versions, which did not originate in the Floridita, are also common in bars worldwide, such as Banana daiquiri and Strawberry daiquiri.</dd></dl>

To a pint sized (568 mL) glass is added large (50 mL) port (usually Cockburns). The glass is filled to half way with <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Stella_Artois&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Stella Artois (does not exist)">Stella Artois</a> and filled with WKD Blue. This unusual combination has a flavour reputed to be both delicious and remarkably similar to that of Vimto.
</p><p>"Atomic Vimto" is made by putting half a pint (284&nbsp;mL) of Stella Artois into a Pint (568&nbsp;mL) glass, and adding 50&nbsp;mL of Port. A shot (25&nbsp;mL) of scotch is added, and topped with WKD Blue. The other option is to double the scotch, use 75&nbsp;mL of port and fill the rest with WKD Blue. Other names include Cheeky Vimto.

Eggnog typically consists of milk, eggs and sugar mixed together and may be served with or without added spirits. Other ingredients include spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander or allspice. Eggnog is typically served as a winter drink.

<p>Build as a highball. An origin legend tells that the traditional gin and tonic came about when British colonists in India, drinking a far more bitter anti-malarial tonic, mixed gin with the medicine to make it palatable. Whether or not the story is true, the tonic water used as a present-day mixer contains only a fraction of the quinine, and is sweetened.

<p>The following is a very classic variation of Glögg:
</p>
<ul><li>1 bottle (750&nbsp;mL) of red wine</li>
<li>150&nbsp;mL (5 oz) of vodka</li>
<li>7 pcs of cinnamon</li>
<li>20 cloves</li>
<li>ginger</li>
<li>cardamom</li>
<li>200&nbsp;mL (7 fl oz) of sugar</li>
<li>1 tbsp (15&nbsp;mL) of vanilla sugar</li></ul>
<p>Avoid using cardamom powder or cinnamon powder. Mix together the spices and pour in the vodka. Let the mixture soak for at least a day. Separate the spices from the vodka, and pour in the wine. Heat the mixture, but do not let it boil. Serve warm with raisins and almonds. Glögg is the Scandinavian version of vin chaud or mulled wine. The main ingredients are (usually red) wine, spices such as cinnamon and cloves, and optionally also stronger spirits such as vodka or even Cognac. The mixture is prepared by heating, but it is not allowed to boil in order for the alcohol not to evaporate. Glögg is generally served with raisins and almonds, and is a popular warm drink during the Christmas season. In Denmark glögg is traditionally served during the Christmas season with <i>æbleskiver</i> (apple dumplings) sprinkled with powdered sugar and accompanied with strawberry marmalade. Glögg recipes vary widely, and variations with sweet wines such as Madeira or spirits such as Cognac or Armagnac are also very popular. Try brandy instead of vodka for robustness. Glögg can also be made alcohol-free by using juices or by boiling the Glögg for a few minutes to evaporate the alcohol.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.gretchencooks.com/recipes/582_Glogg">[21]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ling.su.se/staff/evali/glogg.htm">[22]</a>

Serving it cold helps keeps the taste and makes the flavour last longer than served warm. It also helps keep the milk in it cold. There are many varying recipes for this drink.

<li>30&nbsp;mL Pisang Ambon liqueur</li>
<li>20&nbsp;mL milk</li>
<li>fill with Sprite soda</li></ul>
<p>Then mix everything and serve. Here the Absolut vodka comes from Sweden and is produced from distilled winter wheat.  One can taste a bit of dried fruit in in, when it is drank straight. It can also come in other flavours, such as Absolut Peppar or Absolut Mandarin. The best way to serve it is in a Collins cup.

<dl><dt>Hangman's  Blood</dt>
<dd>This is a drink first described by Richard Hughes in his 1929 novel, <i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i>.  According to Hughes,</dd>
<dd>Hangman's blood ... is compounded of rum, gin, brandy, and porter ... Innocent (merely beery) as it looks, refreshing as it tastes, it has the property of increasing rather than allaying thirst, and so once it has made a breach, soon demolishes the whole fort <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>In the 1960s novelist Anthony Burgess described its preparation as follows:
</p>
<dl><dd>Into a pint glass [568&nbsp;mL], doubles [i.e. 50&nbsp;mL measures] of the following are poured: gin, whisky, rum, port and brandy. A small bottle of stout is added and the whole topped up with champagne....It tastes very smooth, induces a somewhat metaphysical elation, and rarely leaves a hangover.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Hanky-Panky</dt>
<dd>1.5 oz (45&nbsp;mL) gin, 1.5 oz (45&nbsp;mL) sweet vermouth, 2 dashes Fernet Branca. Pour all the ingredients into a Martini glass half full of ice cubes. Stir well to combine and chill. Strain into a chilled Martini glass. The Hanky-Panky cocktail was the brainchild of Ada Coleman. Her benefactor, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, a member of the D'Oyly Carte family that first produced Gilbert and Sullivan operas in London, and the family that built the Savoy Hotel. When Rupert became chairman of the Savoy in 1903, Ada was given a position at the hotel's American Bar, where she eventually became the head bartender and made cocktails for the likes of Mark Twain, the Prince of Wales, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden and Sir Charles Hawtrey. Charles Hawtrey was the man for whom "Coley", as Ada Coleman was affectionately called, created the Hanky-Panky cocktail. He was an Victorian and Edwardian actor who mentored Noel Coward. Coley herself told the story behind the creation of the Hanky-Panky to England's The People newspaper in 1925:</dd></dl>
<p>"The late Charles Hawtrey ... was one of the best judges of cocktails that I knew. Some years ago, when he was overworking, he used to come into the bar and say, 'Coley, I am tired. Give me something with a bit of punch in it.' It was for him that I spent hours experimenting until I had invented a new cocktail. The next time he came in, I told him I had a new drink for him. He sipped it, and, draining the glass, he said, 'By Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!' And Hanky-Panky it has been called ever since."
</p><p>The Hanky-Panky is a variation on the sweet Martini, inasmuch as it calls for gin and sweet vermouth, but Coley's secret ingredient was Fernet Branca, a bitter Italian digestivo. By adding just a couple of dashes of this herbal elixir, she transformed the drink into a masterpiece. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/371992/104-1140161-1419917">[23]</a>

<dl><dt>Harvey Wallbanger</dt>
<dd>Ice cubes, 2 measures (60&nbsp;mL) vodka,  2/3 measure (20&nbsp;mL) Galliano, 5 measures (150&nbsp;mL) orange juice, 1 slice of orange. Half-fill the shaker with ice cubes. Add the vodka and orange juice, and shake well. Strain into an ice-filled highball glass. Gently float the Galliano on top, and garnish with the orange slice. This well known tipple was one of many cocktails invented by renowned, (and two times world champion) mixologist Donato 'Duke' Antone (other notable 'Duke' creations are the Rusty Nail, The Godfather and the Flaming Caesar). This is one of many cocktails invented by 'Duke' in Los Angeles during the 1950's. According to legend, Harvey was actually a Californian surfer. After losing an important contest, he consoled himself in Duke's Blackwatch bar with one of his 'special' screwdriver cocktails, (a screwdriver with a dash of Galliano liqueur). After several drinks, he tried to leave the bar, but unfortunately kept bumping into the furniture and walls. Harvey 'the Wallbanger' became his nickname and the famous drink was named. In 2005, the American-based Food Network listed the Harvey Wallbanger cocktail as number four in its list of the top five fad foods of the 1970s.</dd></dl>

<dd>First pour a shot (30&nbsp;mL) of an Irish Whiskey such as Jameson or Tullamore Dew into a glass, and add about a pint (568&nbsp;mL) of Irish beer such as Guinness or Murphy's. Drop a shot (30&nbsp;mL) of Irish Cream such as Bailey's (including the shot glass) into the glass of beer. Immediately drink the mix. The Guinness beer and Irish Cream Liqueur will curdle together as soon as they make contact.  The Irish Carbomb should be completely drunk before the drink has completely curdled.  If done correctly, an Irish Carbomb should taste chocolatey.</dd></dl>

<dd>Strong black coffee, brown sugar, whiskey, very lightly whipped cream. Put a metal spoon in a wine glass and pour in the hot coffee. Leave about 1.5&nbsp;cm space above the coffee. The spoon helps to prevent the glass cracking. Mix two teaspoons (10&nbsp;mL) of sugar and the whiskey into the coffee, and remove the spoon. The amount of sugar can be suited to the drinker. Also, the more sugar in the coffee, the easier the final step is. Hold a tablespoon upside down over the glass, and slowly pour the cream over the back of the spoon onto the surface of the coffee mixture. It should float.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Irish Rootbeer Float</dt>
<dd>In a chilled glass mug: 1 part rootbeer (preferably a frothy, flavourful variety), 1 part Bailey's Irish Cream, 1 part vodka. The Irish rootbeer float is a relatively new invention, finding its origins in the Southwestern region of Pennsylvania. It is a creamy, sweet beverage that utilises the mild neutral flavour of vodka to excellent effect, having a deceptively high alcohol content. The mix itself is very simple and versatile. Many feel that an Irish rootbeer float can act as a better introduction to spirits than beer, which is a far more common introduction to alcoholic beverages. The recipe is not written in stone, and the ratio may be adjusted to taste without compromising the overall flavour of the beverage. The Even-more Irish Rootbeer Float is a  variation in which some, or all of the vodka is substituted with whiskey. Whilst a minor variation, it does result in a definitively different drink. The flavour is richer and more caustic and far less conducive to first-time drinkers. It does stay truer to its namesake, however. It comprises: 1 part rootbeer, 1 part Bailey's Irish Cream, 1 part whiskey (or a mixture of some part whiskey, some part vodka).</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Irish Trash Can</dt>
<dd>Served in chilled bar glass or mug: Fill the glass ½ to ¾ full of ice. Add 1 straw.</dd></dl>
<p>Add 1 shot of each of the following clear wells. Vodka, Rum, Gin, Tequila ,&amp; Triple Sec.
Next drizzle in 1 shot of Blue Curaçao, covering all of the ice cubes.
Now dump one 8 oz can Red Bull energy drink upside down into the glass, allowing it to float.
Drink through the straw, and as you desire, lift the can of Red Bull to replenish the drink.

<dl><dt>Jello Shot</dt>
<dd>Jello shots are made from flavoured gelatin dessert mix and distilled alcohol. The most commonly used liquors are rum and vodka, but almost any type is suitable. A jello shot is usually made in shot glasses, disposable paper cups, or small 2&nbsp;oz (60&nbsp;mL) plastic condiment containers. These condiment containers can be purchased in bulk, and come with lids to prevent alcohol evaporation. A jello shot is made just like regular gelatin desserts. Half of the total water required by the recipe is boiled, and then the mix is dissolved into the water. The remaining half of the water is replaced with liquor. Storing the alcohol in the freezer overnight helps chill and set the jello shots quicker. They take at least a couple of hours to set. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer" class="extiw" title="w:Tom Lehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> claimed to have invented jello shots during his time with the Army, in the 1950s, as a way of circumventing the military post's liquor restrictions.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> However, the earliest published recipe dates from 1862, and is found in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=QDUEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA22,M1"><i>How to Mix Drinks, or The Bon Vivant's Companion</i></a> by <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Jerry_Thomas_(bartender)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jerry Thomas (bartender) (does not exist)">Jerry Thomas</a>: the recipe calls for gelatin, cognac, rum, and lemon juice.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dd>2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) vodka, 2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) Baileys, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) coconut oil, 2 grams of crushed mint or peppermint, plenty of ice to top up glass. The Kalisto comet is a unique blend of vodka and Baileys drink; a slight variation is to use Tia lusso as opposed to Baileys as many find the combination of vodka and Baileys to be quite an acquired taste and can be sickly in taste for those not into Baileys too much. The ingredients of the cocktail are selected to make the drink smooth and easy on the senses with the vodka being the most potent ingredient used, the mint used is usually peppermint although an equally preferred alternative can also be spearmint to further add to the smooth taste.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Mai_Tai" title="Bartending/Cocktails/Mai Tai">Mai Tai</a></dt>
<dd>The Maitai is a well-known cocktail purportedly invented at the Trader Vic restaurant in Oakland, California in 1944.  Trader Vic's amicable rival, Don the Beachcomber, claimed to have created it first in 1933 at his own newly opened little bar (later a famous restaurant) in Hollywood.  The Beachcomber's recipe is far more complicated than that of the Trader's and tastes quite different. Maitai is the Tahitian word for "good". The Trader Vic story of its invention is that the Trader (Victor J. Bergeron) created it one afternoon for some friends who were visiting from Tahiti.  One of them tasted it and cried out: "Maitai roa!" ("Very good!")  Hence the name. The first three of the following Maitai recipes are provided by Trader Vic's to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.kevdo.com/maitai/">The Search for the Ultimate Mai Tai</a> website.</dd>
<dd>Recipe 1: The Original Trader Vic Formula - 1944: 2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) of 17-year old J. Wray and Nephew Rum over shaved ice. Add juice from one fresh lime. ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) Holland DeKuyper Orange Curaçao, ¼ oz (7.5&nbsp;mL) Trader Vic's Rock Candy Syrup. ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) French Garnier Orgeat Syrup. Shake vigorously. Add a sprig of fresh mint. Recipe 2: "Old Way" Trader Vic Maitai Formula - 1997: 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) Fine Jamaican rum (15 or 8 year old), 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) Martinique rum (St. James), ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) Orange Curaçao, ½ ounce (15&nbsp;mL) Orgeat Syrup, juice from one fresh lime (about ¾ oz[20&nbsp;mL]). Mix and serve as in the original formula. Recipe 3: <b>Today's Trader Vic Maitai</b> (This recipe is very close to what Trader Vic's restaurants apparently serve.): 2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) triple sec, ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) lime juice, ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) Orgeat syrup, ½ tsp (2.5&nbsp;mL) grenadine, maraschino cherry, pineapple. Shake all the ingredients in a shaker with ice and strain into an old fashioned glass over crushed ice. Garnish with fruits and serve with a straw. Recipe 4: Don the Beachcomber Maitai: This version is much closer to what Don the Beachcomber served in his restaurants.  It can be garnished with various fruits, as in the above recipe.  Falernum, which is now difficult to obtain in the United States except from a single supplier in Seattle, is a flavored Caribbean syrup with a very different taste from the Orgeat syrup used in the Maitai 1. Ingredients: 2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) water, ¾ oz (20&nbsp;mL) fresh lime juice, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) fresh grapefruit juice, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) sugar syrup, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) dark rum, 1½ oz (20&nbsp;mL) golden rum, ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) Cointreau or triple sec, ¼ oz (7.5&nbsp;mL) Falernum syrup, 2 dashes or scant ½ tsp Angostura bitters, 1 dash or scant ¼ tsp Pernod or other anisette-flavoured pastis. Shake all the ingredients in a shaker with ice and strain into a tall highball glass filled with crushed ice. Garnish with fruits and serve with a straw. Recipe 5: Pineapple Variation Maitai: 4 oz (120&nbsp;mL) orange juice, 4 oz (120&nbsp;mL) pineapple juice, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) lime juice, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) dark rum, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) triple sec, ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) grenadine.</dd></dl>

<dd>3 oz (90&nbsp;mL) cherry brandy, 2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) cherry 7-up, 2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) cherry soda, whipped cream, a cherry. All liquids should be chilled and mixed with a stirring stick.

<dd>There are any number of variations to this drink, but two of the more popular recipes are The Original Manhattan and The Perfect Manhattan. Classic Manhattan: 1½ shots (45&nbsp;mL) bourbon (quality counts up to a point. Something like Early Times is quite adequate.)</dd></dl>
<p>⅓ shot (10&nbsp;mL) sweet vermouth (quality really counts here and most domestics are out.) 2 shakes of bitters, 1 tbl (15&nbsp;mL) cherry juice. Garnish with Cherry. Serve up in stemware or on the rocks. The Original Manhattan: 1 shot bourbon (30&nbsp;mL), ¼ shot (7.5&nbsp;mL) sweet vermouth, dash bitters. Stir ingredients in a large glass with ice. Strain into chilled cocktail glass and garnish with a maraschino cherry. The Perfect Manhattan: 1 shot bourbon, ¼ shot sweet vermouth, dash bitters, rinse dry vermouth. Stir whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters in a large glass with ice. Rinse chilled cocktail glass with dry vermouth (pour only a little in the glass, swirl it around and pour it out). Strain chilled ingredients into cocktail glass and garnish with a lemon twist. If someone requests it extra dry you could use no vermouth at all.

<dl><dt>Maria Teresa</dt>
<dd>4 oz (120&nbsp;mL) of orange juice, 2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) of orange liqueur (such as Cointreau, triple sec or Grand Marnier), 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) of grenadine, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) of lime juice.

<dd>1 measure (30&nbsp;mL) dry vermouth, 5 measures (150&nbsp;mL) gin, 2 olives. Pour a small splash of vermouth in the shaker. Add gin to the mix.  Melted ice will bring the liquid content up to 3 oz (90&nbsp;mL) total. Prepare as a stirred cocktail. Mixing a Martini is a trying task, as it is difficult to measure out just enough vermouth. Harvard suggests using a metal shaker and rimming the full edge with the liquid. This means pouring in enough that the liquid coats the bottom of the shaker, but doesn't start to fill it.  A dry Martini can be made by rimming half the shaker, leaving part of the bottom untouched by vermouth; and an extra dry Martini is done by splashing a little vermoth in the shaker, swirling it around, and dumping it back out before adding the gin.

<dl><dt>Michelada</dt>
<dd>Very popular Mexican cocktail.  Preparation differs from state to state. This recipe is in the San Luis Potosí/Cuernavaca style: 355&nbsp;mL beer (any kind will do), 120&nbsp;mL Clamato (Clam-Tomato cocktail; optional, but highly recommended), 1 or 2 lemons, Worcestershire Sauce, maggi juice, Black-Label Valentina Sauce (hard to get for people outside of Mexico), salt, pepper, chilled beer mug, ice. Have a beer mug chilled, then frost it with salt and lemon. Pour in about 25&nbsp;to&nbsp;35&nbsp;mL of Valentina Sauce. Squeeze in your lemons. Add some Worcestershire sauce, then the Maggi juice. Now, salt and pepper to taste, then stir. Add your 120&nbsp;mL of Clamato, then keep stirring. Finally, pour in your beer while you keep stirring. Add some ice if you like. There's no secret for mixing the best Michelada, it must suit your taste. If you want to make liter-sized Micheladas, you need to vary proportionally the quantity of ingredients shown in this table.  But then again, it must please you.  It's some sort of acquired taste. You must not replace the Valentina sauce with some other kind of sauce (say, Tabasco). It won't taste the same.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Midnight Baya</dt>
<dd>This drink was created in Kissimmee, Florida by Brent M. Farmer in 2006. It is a variation of the traditional mojito that substitutes the lime with blueberries and blackberries, and regular clear rum with vanilla flavor rum. 4-6 blueberries, 4-6 blackberries, 6-9 mint leaves (optional), sugar (optional), 1 part vanilla flavored rum, 3 parts club soda, and 3-4 raspberries. Place the blueberries and blackberries into a shaker, muddle them well with a pestle, add the vanilla rum and fill the shaker with ice, then shake well (up to 30 times). Afterwards, pour it through a strainer (to filter out the berry skins) into a tall ice filled glass, top it with the club soda, stir and garnish with raspberries. Mint leaves can be added for a more traditional mojito flavor and sugar for extra sweetness.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Negroni</dt>
<dd>1 part gin, 1 part Campari, 1 part sweet vermouth. Shake the ingredients with ice. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a twist of lemon. Common substitutes include vodka for the gin, dry vermouth for the sweet, or a twist of orange instead of lemon. According to the most popular origin story, the Negroni was invented in Florence, Italy in the early 1920s. It was named after Count Camillo Negroni, the man who invented it by asking a bartender to add gin to the Americano, his favourite drink. However, the word Negroni doesn't appear in English cocktail guides before 1947, so the drink's true origins are uncertain. The Negroni is an apéritif, or pre-dinner cocktail, intended to stimulate the drinker's appetite. There is also a variant, popular in Italy, named Negroni <i>sbagliato</i> where the gin is substituted with spumante brut. A Negroni Malato ("Sick" Negroni) is a Negroni served with orange juice</dd></dl>

<dd>A recipe with many variations, almost always featuring bourbon and sugar. Add slice of orange, tsp of sugar (5&nbsp;mL) or simple syrup, maraschino cherry (without stem) and two dashes of Angostura bitters to bottom of an Old Fashioned glass. Fill glass with ice. Add 2&nbsp;oz (60&nbsp;mL) bourbon and stir. Serve with stir or short straw. An Old Fashioned glass is similar to a bucket or tumbler. This drink is sometimes ordered as a call.

<dl><dt>One-Balled Dictator</dt>
<dd>1 part good champagne, 5 parts cheap liebfraumilch.  Shake the concoction very violently but for a short duration, then pour into a "rocks" type glass.  Before drinking, add one cinnamon ball, the type found in bags of bulk candy.  You now have a One-Balled Dictator.  A splash of Galliano liqueur added just before shaking will create a Mussolini. One-Balled Dictator is a wine cocktail drunk by World War II veterans. The name is seen by some as a little unorthodox, yet is still seen as a reasonably tasty drink. Symbolism: The combination of the milky-white liebfraumilch with the champagne will produce a very white drink, where the German very quickly overwhelms the French.  The wide-mouthed rocks glass provides breathing room for the drink, which has only one ball. Taken together, this is clearly a joke reference to Adolf Hitler, who, after the invasion of Poland, took over France in a very successful and fast way, through the "lightning war" or blitzkrieg, during the early years of World War II. The reference to Hitler's "one ball" comes from the lyrics to a crude song sung by British soldiers, to the tune of the Colonel Bogey March. Although the symbolism renders this primarily a joke recipe, the actual drink produced is unique and quite pleasant.  The fiery taste of the cinnamon gives an interesting contrast to the "cooler" flavour of the white wines. This drink originated in Cincinnati, Ohio in the late 1940s, concocted by veteran members of the US 82nd Airborne Division.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Punch</dt>
<dd>Punch is a general term for any of a wide assortment of mixed drinks, either soft or alcoholic, often containing fruit or fruit juice. Punch is typically served at parties in large, wide bowls known as punchbowls. In a large number of Caribbean, Pacific or Indian Ocean countries, punch is also drunk as an aperitif before meals. The original drink was made from five different ingredients, namely arrack, sugar, lemon, water and tea. Because of this it was named <i>panch</i> which is the Hindi for <i>five</i>.  This name was adopted by the sailors of the British East India Company and brought back to England, from where it was introduced into other European countries.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>In Germanic culture, punch (or <i>Punsch</i> in German) refers to a mixture of several fruit juices and spices, often with wine or liquor added. Punch is popular in Germany, as well as with many Germans who emigrated to America. The traditional German Christmas often includes a Feuerzangenbowle ("Burnt Punch" or "Burning Fire Tongs Bowl").  This is a punch made from red wine, and flaming rum poured over a sugar hat, a large conical sugar cube placed on the "Feuerzange" which supports it above the bowl. In Korean culture, <i>sujeonggwa</i> is a traditional punch made from dried persimmons, cinnamon and ginger.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Recipes: A very simple punch recipe is to add sherbet to chilled ginger ale; Summer Cup: wash and hull a large punnet of strawberries and put them in a large bowl with 100&nbsp;mL of gin and 50&nbsp;mL of Cointreau.  Allow them to soak for a while. Add plenty of ice, and a bottle of medium dry white sparkling wine. Top up with at least 500&nbsp;mL of soda water to taste. Serve in long tall glasses with a sprig of mint. Typical alcoholic punch generally contains cask wine, Passion Pop or similar, juice, soft drink, cordial and vodka.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Radler</dt>
<dd>Radler', German for <i>cyclist</i>, is a traditional mixture of beer and a soft drink, mostly carbonated and orange or lemon flavoured, in South Eastern Germany (Bavaria) and adjacent provinces. It is refreshing, and its alcohol content is low, depending on the beer's alcohol content as it is normally mixed 1:1. There is however enough alcohol to provide a momentary surplus energy which might be a clue for the word's etymology: to be the beverage of cyclists as it does not make them drunk but makes the most of the alcohol it contains.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Ramos Gin Fizz</dt>
<dd>2 ounces (60&nbsp;mL) gin, 3 drops orange flower water, 1 egg whites, 1 teaspoon (5&nbsp;mL) bar sugar, 1 ounce (30&nbsp;mL) lemon juice, ½ ounce (15&nbsp;mL) lime juice, 1 ounce (30&nbsp;mL) cream, soda water to taste.

<dl><dt>Rene</dt>
<dd>Vodka, club soda, lime. The ingredients are served over ice with a slice or wedge of lime squeezed into the drink.  The proportions may be varied to make a stronger or weaker cocktail.  It is most often made using 1 part vodka to 3 parts club soda, but if a stronger Rene is desired, use equal parts of vodka and club soda. The Rene is low in carbohydrates when compared with many other mixed drinks.  Its refreshingly light taste makes it a natural favourite during the warmer months of the year.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Sangria</dt>
<dd>Liquids: 50% wine, 25% orange juice, 12.5% Sprite/7up, 12.5% <i>Tango</i> Tropical, 1 bottle of grapefruit liquor for every 30 litres. Solids: 1 500&nbsp;g tin pineapple, 3 tins peach, 4 oranges, 3 limes, 2 lemons, 2-3 applies, half a sweet melon. It is recommend to add&nbsp;750 mL of liquor for every 30 litres, some Cointreau or brandy, but when money is short then "generic" vodka would do. Remember, in a good sangria, there is never too much fruit. So, if in doubt, go for it. And in the end, ice is always a good idea so remember to buy it the day before and add it 10 or 15 minutes before the party starts. To prepare the sangria you'll need half a day or so, but the preparation shouldn't take more than an hour. Start by cutting all the fruits, pealing the citrics but leaving the apples skin on. Then pour all the wine in a container and all the fruits in with the wine. Add the sugar to taste (this would depend on how many fruits you had) and some cinnamon (be generous). Then leave to rest for 4-6 hours so that the wine soaks all the fruits and all the sugar dissolves well. Just before the party starts, add the rest of the liquids and ice.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.alicante-spain.com/spain-tips/sangria-recipe.html">[27]</a></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Sangrita is a popular beverage to drink with tequila. This beverage is a tangy mixture of tomato and orange juices, usually spiked with hot chilis and lime juice. It may sound odd in flavour, but sangrita is the perfect accompaniment to good quality tequila, like an aged anejo or a good reposado. The tequila and sangrita are poured into separate shot glasses and the two are alternately sipped, not chased. First the tequila, then the chilled sangrita. Slowly, one after the other.</dd></dl>

<dd>2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) rye whiskey (Old Overholt is the predominant brand in New Orleans, but Jim Beam and Wild Turkey also make a Rye), 1 tbsp (15&nbsp;mL) Simple Syrup (granulated sugar dissolved in boiling water, thicker is better), 6 dashes of Peychaud's Bitters (there is no substitute, seriously), 6 dashes of absinthe (Herbsaint/Pernod is an acceptable substitute). Chill (or even freeze) a double old fashioned glass or tumbler. (Avoid using ice to chill the glass, because it makes the sides of the glass too watery for the Herbsaint.) Coat the inside of the glass with the Herbsaint. Roll the glass so that it doesn't puddle in the bottom. Add the rye, simple syrup and bitters with a splash of water.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The Sazerac is one of the oldest cocktails. The original recipe was developed by Antoine Peychaud (pay-show) in his New Orleans' French Quarter apothecary, circa 1820. Peychaud's drink was then popularised at a Coffee House in the French Quarter, called the Sazerac Coffee House. One version of the history says that the proprietor of the Sazerac Coffee House, was also the importer of Sazerac de Forge et fils (Sazerac &amp; Sons) Cognac. Over time, the recipe evolved from cognac to rye whiskey. Peychaud was developing his bitters as a curative for heart burn and indigestion, and added the cognac-absinthe concoction with sugar, to make it palatable. Even today, Peychaud's bitters mixed with club soda is a bartender's quick antidote for indigestion. Bitters and lemon is also used (by bartenders) to treat hiccoughs. Sazerac™ is often considered closest to the original recipe, however it is a trade secret.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Tailspin</dt>
<dd>¾ oz (20&nbsp;mL) sweet vermouth, ¾ oz (20&nbsp;mL) gin, ¾ oz (20&nbsp;mL) green Chartreuse, 1 dash orange bitters, 1 twist lemon peel, 1 cherry.

<dl><dt>Tamagozake</dt>
<dd>Pour 1 cup (250&nbsp;mL) of sake and a beaten egg into a small saucepan. Heat the mixture over a low flame, stirring continuously. Remove from heat before it comes to the boil. Mix in one to two teaspoons (5-10&nbsp;mL) of sugar. It should appear a little thick and creamy.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Teknekt (or Teknert)</dt>
<dd>Mix a half cup (125&nbsp;mL) of tea with a half cup (125&nbsp;mL) of moonshine and adding sugar. Sometimes the moonshine is replaced with rum. The name is probably from Scandinavia, where "knert" means (approximately) "add a dose of moonshine".</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Tequila Manhattan</dt>
<dd>1.5 oz (45&nbsp;mL) gold tequila, several dashes sweet vermouth, 1 slice of lime. The tequila and vermouth is mixed with cracked ice in a shaker or blender and strained into a chilled cocktail glass. It is garnished with the lime slice. Dry vermouth can be used as a substitute for the sweet variety, depending on taste, or a combination of sweet/dry vermouth can be used.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Tequini Martini</dt>
<dd>1½ oz (45&nbsp;mL) tequila, ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) dry vermouth, 1 dash Bitters, 1 twist of lemon peel, 1 olive. Stir tequila, vermouth and bitters with ice and strain into a cocktail glass. Add the twist of lemon peel, top with the olive, and serve.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Ti'Punch</dt>
<dd>50&nbsp;mL white agricultural rum, 10&nbsp;mL cane syrup (cane sugar also works), ½ lime. Pour rum, then cane juice. Squeeze lime juice, then drop lime into drink. Stir. The Ti'Punch is a rum-based mixed drink that is especially popular in Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guyana and other French-speaking Caribbean states. It is usually served as an apéritif before starting a meal, both as a matter of tradition and because the drink itself is strongly alcoholic. A popular tradition is that of <i>chacun prépare sa propre mort</i> (roughly, each prepares his own death), where instead of serving the mixed drink, the bartender or host will simply place out the ingredients, and everyone will prepare the drink according to their own taste. Opinions differ as to whether it should be served with or without ice, but most agree that the "real" ti'punch should be served without ice.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Tinto De Verano</dt>
<dd>1 bottle (750&nbsp;mL) of red wine, 500&nbsp;mL of lemonade, lots of ice. Pour the wine and lemonade into a pitcher and throw in lots of ice. If you feel like a stronger drink, add a shot of rum, or a vermouth such as <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Martini&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Martini (does not exist)">martini</a>. Pour into tall glasses and garnish with a twist of lemon. Tinto de Verano is a refreshing wine based cocktail similar to sangria which is very popular in Andalucia. The name translates as <i>red wine of summer</i>, and it is commonly drunk in summer. It is very refreshing, and is commonly served in beachside <i>chiringuitos</i>. It is also often home-made, or indeed bought ready-bottled from supermarkets. In the Costa del Sol it is common for locals to drink tinto verano while tourists drink sangria. Notes: The wine should be full bodied, but does not need to be expensive, a cheap <i>tempranillo</i> will do; the lemonade used should not be too sweet or taste strongly of lemon, but rather should be as close as possible to Spanish <i>gaseosa</i> or <i>casera</i>, which is carbonated water with a hint of artificial lemon flavouring and a hint of artificial sweetener. A stronger or sweeter lemonade such as Fanta, or traditional Americal lemonade will not do. If this kind of lemonade is unavailable, it can be replaced with carbonated water some sugar and a little lemon. Sprite would work, though it is not ideal, diet or lite sprite would work well. Tinto verano can be served with fruit, which makes it very similar to sangria.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.meish.org/files/tinto_de_verano.php">[32]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.recipezaar.com/148074">[33]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.guisando.org/recetas/tintoverano.html">[34]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.yanuq.com/buscador.asp?idreceta=199">[35]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.patriamadre.com/content/InfoDetalle.asp?id=777">[36]</a></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Tom Collins</dt>
<dd>Cracked ice, 1.5 oz (45&nbsp;mL) gin, juice of one lemon (about 1 oz [30&nbsp;mL]), 1 tsp (5&nbsp;mL) fine sugar or sugar syrup, club soda. Garnish. Fill a Collins glass up about two-thirds with ice. Add sugar, lemon juice and gin. Stir well. Top off glass with club soda. A garnish, such as a maraschino cherry, is optional. Variations include using (unsweetened) lime juice instead of lemon juice; skipping the sugar in the above recipe, and using lemon-lime soda instead of club soda; and using "Collins mixer" soda (essentially slightly sweet lime soda) om place of the lime juice, sugar and club soda.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Tombstone</dt>
<dd>1 part barley wine, 2 parts cider. It is popular in England, especially in Gloucestershire.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Trader Vic's Rum Fizz</dt>
<dd>1½ oz (45&nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) lemon juice, 2 tsp (10&nbsp;mL) sugar, 1 egg, ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) chilled cream soda, grated orange rind. Shake juice, sugar, egg and rum with ice.  Strain and top with cream soda.  Polish off with grated orange rind. This is a Gin Fizz (qv) made with egg yolk instead of egg white.  A Royal Fizz uses both. Give the drink its fizz with champagne instead of soda water and you've got a Diamond Fizz. And although the most popular Fizzes were anchored with gin, most any spirit can be worked into the routine.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>Tucker Death Mix</dt>
<dd>1&nbsp;litre grain alcohol (such as Everclear), 1 quart (1 L) Gatorade (Tucker says that lemon-lime is the "only true flavour"), 1 can Red Bull. Each batch makes slightly more than 2&nbsp;litres of the 86 proof Tucker Death Mix, similar in alcohol content to a hard liquor such as vodka or rum. It was invented and popularised by Tucker Max as a way to quickly become inebriated. Variation: A variation of the Tucker Death Mix that appears in drinksmixer.com and freedrinkrecipes.com replaces 250&nbsp;mL of grain alcohol with a second can of Red Bull, substituting alcohol content for flavour and caffeine.  The volume produced is still the same but the alcoholic content is reduced to 32.4% (65 proof).  Note: drinksmixer.com has the alternative composition listed as being 59 proof, which is presumably a miscalculation. The origins of the alternative composition of TDM are not known; however, it is worth noting that since Tucker Max was the eponymous originator of the beverage, the original proportions with higher alcohol content appearing on his website should be technically considered more correct.</dd></dl>

<dd>A "virgin drink" is a drink without alcohol. Virgin cocktails, or Mock-tails, are all mixers and no liquor.

<dl><dt>Walter De Camp</dt>
<dd>40&nbsp;mL bourbon, 20&nbsp;mL lemon juice, 10&nbsp;mL maple syrup, 2 drops Angostura, ice, slice of orange (for decoration). The drink was designed by Jasu Piasecki. It is named after a Finnish writer who writes answers to questions about partying, restaurants and celebrities in the Finnish City magazine after the writer described that "It has to contain whiskey, be a short drink and taste really good."</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Wedding Belle</dt>
<dd>⅓ dry gin, ⅓ Dubonnet, 1/6 orange juice and 1/6 cherry brandy, shaken with ice and strained into a glass.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Whiskey Sour</dt>
<dd>A Whiskey Sour is made with a double shot (50&nbsp;mL) of whiskey (typically an American whiskey or bourbon will be used), 30&nbsp;mL of lemon juice, 20&nbsp;mL Gomme (a sugar syrup used in most cocktail bars), 2 dashes of Angostura bitters and a dash of egg white if required. The ingredients are then shaken and strained into a rocks (Old Fashioned) glass with cubed ice and garnished with a lemon twist. By increasing the ratio of lemon juice to Gomme one can increase the sourness of the cocktail. Too much Gomme will result in a cocktail that is too sickly and loses its original appeal - being sour. The flavour of a sour, especially a whiskey sour, has been likened to that of sour sweets that leaves the mouth watering and the tongue tingling but always wanting more.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>White Lady (or Delilah)</dt>
<dd>2 oz (60&nbsp;mL) gin, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) lemon juice, 1 oz (30&nbsp;mL) Cointreau or triple sec. Shake or stir with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass, and garnish with a lemon twist. The White Lady is also known as the Delilah, possibly because it has a sweet, delicate flavour that masks its significant alcohol content. It is essentially a Sidecar made with gin in place of brandy.</dd></dl>

<dd>A glass of half beer and half orange juice, with a shot of Amaretto dropped into it. It is similar to an Irish Carbomb or a Boilermaker. Like other similar such drinks, it is meant to be consumed quickly.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Woo Woo (or Woo Woos)</dt>
<dd>1 ¼ oz (35&nbsp;mL) vodka, ½ oz (15&nbsp;mL) peach schnapps, 1 ¼ oz (35&nbsp;mL) cranberry juice. Contents are poured in order over ice in a highball glass.  The juice content can be modified to suit the individual. The cocktail was believed to have been made famous by Aled Jones from the Chris Moyles show on BBC Radio 1. Since then, this drink has picked up a reputation for being popular within the homosexual community.</dd></dl>
